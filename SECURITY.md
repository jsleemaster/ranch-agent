- Security overview: https://github.com/jsleemaster/ranch-agent/security

Do not disclose vulnerability details in public GitHub issues, pull requests, or discussions.

## What to Include in a Report

Please include as many of these details as possible:

- Affected component(s) and impact scope
- Reproduction steps
- Runtime or environment details
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Proof-of-concept (optional but helpful)

## Response Targets

Project maintainers target:

- Initial acknowledgment within 72 hours
- Status update within 14 days

These are targets, not guaranteed SLAs.

## Disclosure Process

Ranch-Agent follows coordinated disclosure:

1. Private triage and impact assessment
2. Patch or mitigation preparation
3. Public disclosure after a fix or mitigation path is ready

## Supported Versions

- `main` (latest) is the primary supported line
- Older commits or non-latest local builds are best-effort only
